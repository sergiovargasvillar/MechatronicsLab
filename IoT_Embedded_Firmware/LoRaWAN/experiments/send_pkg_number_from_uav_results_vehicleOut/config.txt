# mac set ar <state>
# This command sets the state of the automatic reply. By enabling the automatic reply,
# the module will transmit a packet without a payload immediately after a confirmed
# downlink is received, or when the Frame Pending bit has been set by the server. If set
# to OFF, no automatic reply will be transmitted.

#  mac set dr <dataRate>
# This command sets the MIN AND MAX data rate to be used for the next transmission, 
# The DR will increase one by 1 from MIN_DR to MAX_DR each transmission, then will start
# again to MIN_DR.
# For the description of data rates and the corresponding spreading factors, refer to the
# LoRaWAN™ Specification V1.0.2.
# <dataRate>: decimal number representing the data rate, from 0 and 4, but within the
# limits of the data rate range for the defined channels.
# For DR = 4, the MIN and MAX must be 4, and change the channels with the command
# mac set ch drrange from 64 to 71.

#
# Note: In the US 902-928 band, channels 64 to 71 are restricted to the DR4 data
# rate. This command is valid for those channels, however, the only allowed
# <minRange> and <maxRange> values are 4 4.

# mac set class <class>
# This command sets the end device LoRaWAN operating class. The default end device
# class is Class A. When the class is configured as Class C, the end device will enter
# Class C Continuous Receive mode after the next uplink message is sent. The
# LoRaWAN network server must also configure this node as a Class C node. The network server configuration is performed out of band from LoRaWAN communications.
# For more information on the description of operating in Class C mode, refer to the
# LoRaWAN™ Specification V1.0.2.

# <portno>: decimal number representing the port number, from 1 to 223
# Payload Identification: FPort values help distinguish between different types of payloads within the LoRaWAN frame
# Application layer.
# Helps to filter in the DB, so the same device can send different type of values.
